#### Abstract

This document illustrates the main aspect of our Intelligent Robots final project. 



#### 1. Background and Motivation

In recent years, robots and artificial intelligence have prospered. Robots that have been running in the laboratory have gradually entered the lives of thousands of families. ROS, a tool for robot development, has also been widely used and has become a universal standard in the field of robotics. 



#### 2. Related Work and Novelty of This Work

The problem of organizing multiple robots to effectively cooperate to complete a given task is mainly divided into two parts: 

**2.1. The recognition and positioning of the robot to the target.**

Determine where the robot is located in the work environment. (by using known map information, estimates of the current position of the robot, and observations of the sensor)

**2.2. Task assignment for different robots(communication, coordination and cooperation).**

A reasonable <u>architecture</u> is needed to complete this part.
